# Voidlang
My experiment in creating an end-to-end compiler in C (+ plan9 extensions for inheritance of AST nodes), as well as testing some implementation and design ideas. In progress.

Currently have tokenizing, some parsing with error reporting, and the beginning of control flow flattening.

Run it with:

```bash
bash build_main.sh
./a.out input.void
```
